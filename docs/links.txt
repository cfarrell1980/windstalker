An easy to understand tutorial on interrupt programming on the Arduino. The last section exlains
that Arduinos typically have only access to two external interrupt pins (D2 and D3) but that it
is possible to handle external interrupts on any pin using avrlibc and the appropriate specs for
the microcontroller.
